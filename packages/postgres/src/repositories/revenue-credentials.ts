 * revoke-with-the-owner — and the transactional guarantees each of them needs.
 *
 * Two of those guarantees are the whole reason the functions are not inline
 * updates at the call sites:
 *
 * - **Disconnect erases both ciphertexts in the same UPDATE that disables the
 *   row.** Split into two statements, a crash between them leaves a disabled
 *   credential still holding a decryptable provider key — the exact state the
 *   table's CHECK constraint exists to make impossible.
 * - **Rotation swaps the ciphertext and the key version together**, guarded on
 *   the row not being disabled, so a rotation racing a disconnect loses rather
 *   than resurrecting an erased credential with a fresh secret.

 * that one does: the rows are *site*-scoped and the sites are not being deleted,
 * so nothing else in an account teardown reaches them. Left alone, the sync loop
 * would keep decrypting and using a customer's payment-provider key on behalf of
 * an account that no longer exists — a live, decryptable secret whose only owner
 * has been erased.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** scoped by site: `revokeRevenueCredentialsCreatedBy` is
 * the membership-removal path and answers "this person left this site", while
 * this one answers "this person is gone". An account that connected credentials
 * on four sites has four to revoke, and a site loop would need the membership
 * rows the same transaction is about to delete.
 *
 * Disabled with the ciphertexts erased rather than deleted, because the row is
 * the *site's* connection history and the site is still alive — the same
 * distinction that makes `api_keys_revoke` a revocation and the site
 * vocabulary's `api_keys` a delete.
 *
 * Takes an `Executor`: it runs inside the teardown transaction, beside the key
 * revocation and the membership delete.
