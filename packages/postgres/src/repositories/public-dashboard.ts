/**
 * Public-dashboard settings repository (docs snapshot 02 §20; plan Milestone 7
 * item 8).
 *
 * Three reads and one write:
 *
 * - `getPublicDashboardSettings` — the owner-facing settings for a site id.
 * - `resolvePublicShare` — the public read path's slug → site resolution. It
 *   returns the internal site id, the site's live billing status and the
 *   per-surface flags in one query, so the route can apply the §20 rules (share
 *   is closed while `suspended`; a surface must be individually opted in)
 *   without a second round trip, and a slug never leaks the internal id to a
 *   caller who only holds the slug.
 * - `readPublicSiteIdentity` — the site's display name, favicon domain,
 *   reporting timezone and first-event instant, for the ADR-0044 public
 *   site-identity read. Authorization is `isSharePublishing` plus, for the two
 *   identity fields, `isSurfaceShared(share, 'identity')`; this read makes no
 *   decision of its own.
 * - `updatePublicDashboardSettings` — the owner opt-in/opt-out and slug rotation.

 * Every surface a share can opt into, in the order the settings screen lists
 * them (docs snapshot 02 §20; realtime is M9; the five breakdown reads are
 * ADR-0039; `identity` is ADR-0044).
 *
 * **`identity` is a surface for authorization and not a board card.** It has one
 * flag, one column and one audit key like the other eight, and it gates two
 * fields of `GET /v1/public/{slug}/site` rather than a route of its own — which
 * is why `PUBLISHING_SURFACES` below excludes it when deciding whether a slug
 * publishes anything at all.
 *
 * This array is the single place a surface is declared. `PublicSurfaceFlags`
 * derives its field names from it, `SURFACE_FLAG` maps each entry to one, and
 * `isSurfaceShared` reads through that map — so a surface added to this list
 * without a column and a flag is a type error rather than a silently
 * unauthorized route.
