 *
 * `beforeCreate` is where a refusal belongs: it runs before anything is written,
 * so throwing leaves the database untouched. `afterCreate` runs once the site
 * row exists, which is what a foreign key to it needs.
 *
 * The third hook is the one worth explaining. `afterCreate` runs for **any** site
 * this deployment now has — including one `createSiteWithOwner` made for a fixture
 * or an import — so it is where a fact about the row belongs: who is billed for
 * it, say. `afterGuardedCreate` runs only when a *customer request* created the
 * site, beside the gate that admitted it, and is where a rule about *creating* one
 * belongs. The split exists because the two are not the same claim: a hosted
 * deployment derives a new site's status from its owner's subscription, and

 * database-enforced rather than advisory, which is what makes them hold under
 * concurrency instead of only in the happy path.
 *

 * happen is a trail nobody can read.
 *
 * No realtime epoch bump: realtime authorization is membership-scoped, not
 * role-scoped (`apps/api/src/http/realtime.ts` issues a token from the
