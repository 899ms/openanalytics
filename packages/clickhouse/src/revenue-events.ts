/**
 * The canonical revenue fact's ClickHouse surface (ADR-0033, D5; migration
 * 0016). Milestone 12 Checkpoint 3.
 *
 * Two things live here and nothing else: the typed row shape the worker's
 * projection loop builds, and the two statements that write and read it. Every
 * decision about *what* a row contains — conversion, hashing, which head is due
 * — belongs to the worker, because those need Postgres and a secret this package
 * has no business holding.
 *
 * ## Written by the worker, never by the api
 *
 * `analytics.revenue_events` is a ClickHouse table, so by the standing rule
 * (AGENTS.md, D-208) the api cannot reach it: the api holds no ClickHouse
 * credential at all and reads analytics only through the signed query gateway.
 * The projection loop runs in the worker on the `oa_ingest` credential, which is
 * granted `INSERT` and `SELECT` on this table by the ClickHouse entrypoint XML
 * the deployment ships — the grant is a container recreate, not a SQL `GRANT`,
 * and CP7's deploy has to perform it before the loop can write.
 *
 * ## The insert is synchronous and content-deduplicated
 *
 * Both settings are the session-facts pattern and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * - `async_insert = 0` / `wait_for_async_insert = 1`, because the loop advances
 *   `revenue_objects.projected_version` **after** the insert resolves. An async
 *   insert acknowledges before the block is durable, so the marker would move
 *   past rows ClickHouse had not committed — and unlike a watermark, a marker
 *   never comes back.
 * - `insert_deduplication_token` derived from the rows themselves. A crash
 *   between the insert and the marker re-projects the same heads, which rebuilds
 *   byte-identical rows, which hashes to the same token, which ClickHouse drops.
 *   That is what makes the insert-then-mark ordering safe rather than merely
 *   likely to be safe.
 *
 *   **It rests entirely on the row builder having no clock in it.** The row is a
 *   pure function of `(head, reporting currency, rate plan, hint)`, and
 *   `ingested_at` is `revenue_objects.updated_at` — stable per `(head, version)`
 *   — rather than the projecting tick's time. A clock there would make the
 *   replay build a different row, hash to a different token, and be written as a
 *   second fact at the same version, which is exactly the duplicate the token
 *   exists to prevent.
 *
 *   It also only works because migration 0016 sets
 *   `non_replicated_deduplication_window`; without it the token is accepted and
 *   silently ignored (ADR-0005 measured a 3x from exactly that).
 *
 * ## The read rule is argMax, never FINAL
 *
 * `readCurrentRevenueEvents` exists so CP4's matcher and CP5's rollup have one
 * implementation of the current-truth read rather than two. ReplacingMergeTree's
 * merge is a space reclamation, not a correctness mechanism, so the current
 * version is selected explicitly with `argMax(col, version) GROUP BY key` — and
 * every filter on a *value* column is applied after that grouping, never before,
 * or a superseded version is resurrected. Aggregated columns are qualified
 * through the table alias, because CI's ClickHouse resolves a bare name an alias
 * shadows to the alias and throws ILLEGAL_AGGREGATION.
