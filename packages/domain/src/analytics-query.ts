/**
 * Dashboard rollup selection (docs snapshot 02 §15 "Dashboard query rule",
 * plan Milestone 7 item 7).
 *
 * This is the one place that decides which rollup family answers a
 * `[from, to)` request in a given IANA timezone, and it is deliberately pure so
 * that both the query gateway (Checkpoint B) and the read API (Checkpoint C)
 * reach the same decision from the same inputs. §15's rule is span-based:
 *
 *   - today / realtime       → minute (or hour)
 *   - 7–30 days              → hour (or day)
 *   - 90 days, 6 mo, 1 y, all → day
 *
 * ### The timezone problem
 *
 * Every rollup buckets on `occurred_at` at **UTC** boundaries (migrations
 * 0003–0012, 0025–0026): `metrics_1d.bucket_start` is a UTC midnight,
 * `*_15m.bucket_start` a UTC quarter-hour. A site's "day", however, begins at
 * midnight in its own IANA timezone. So a non-UTC day cannot be read from
 * `*_1d` — its UTC-day buckets straddle two local days. It must be composed
 * from `*_15m` with ClickHouse's timezone-aware
 * `toStartOfDay(bucket_start, {tz:String})`, which also produces the correct
 * 23-/25-hour days across a DST transition.
 *
 * That composition only works when each stored bucket belongs wholly to one
 * local day — i.e. when the zone's offset is a whole number of bucket widths.
 * With the hour atom this file was built on, zones on a sub-hour offset
 * (Asia/Kolkata +05:30, Asia/Kathmandu +05:45, Australia/Lord_Howe +10:30) had
 * a local midnight — and every local hour boundary — falling in the *middle* of
 * a UTC hour, and were refused rather than misattributed. ADR-0079 moved the
 * atom to fifteen minutes, which is the coarsest grain every IANA offset in
 * force since 1979 is a multiple of, so those zones compose exactly like any
 * other and are served by the same path.
 *
 * What remains refusable is an offset that is not a multiple of fifteen minutes
 * at all. The last one in the tz database ended on 1979-10-01, when
 * Pacific/Kiritimati left −10:40, so only a historical range can reach this
 * class — but the rule is enforced rather than assumed, because a range that
 * dips into such an offset would otherwise be answered with buckets split down
 * the middle. Rather than return misattributed buckets, this function reports
 * such combinations as **not servable** and names why; the caller surfaces that
 * instead of a wrong number.
 *
 * The rule this encodes, therefore:
 *
 * | timezone class | minute grain | hour grain | day grain                    |
 * |----------------|--------------|------------|------------------------------|
 * | UTC            | `metrics_1m` | `*_15m`    | `*_1d` (direct)              |
 * | local          | `metrics_1m` | `*_15m`    | `*_15m` via toStartOfDay(tz) |
 * | unservable     | `metrics_1m` | not served | not served                   |
 *
 * Timezone is never spliced into SQL here: this module only *classifies* the
 * zone and picks a resolution. The gateway binds the zone as a `{tz:String}`
 * parameter (docs snapshot 02 §18).

 * path: a request with no `resolution` never reaches here, so the span-based
 * ladder and everything that depends on it behave exactly as before.
 *
 * The forcing rule is deliberately *not* "anything the caller asks for". A
 * grain is honoured only where the automatic selector could already have served
 * it for this range and timezone — the same source-rollup span caps, the same
 * timezone-alignment classes. What forcing buys the caller is the freedom to ask
 * for hour buckets over a fortnight the ladder would have given days for, not
 * the freedom to ask for a number no rollup can produce truthfully. A grain that
 * fails those checks comes back `servable: false` with the precise reason, which
 * the API surfaces as `RESOLUTION_NOT_AVAILABLE`.
 *
 * ### Week
 *
 * `week` is the one grain automatic selection never picks, and the only one with
 * no rollup family of its own. It is the ISO week — Monday start — **in the
 * request timezone**, which is exactly why no week rollup exists: a stored
 * UTC-week bucket would be the wrong seven days for every zone but UTC, and the
 * DST-crossing weeks (167h and 169h) would be wrong for all of them. So it is
 * grouped at read time, from the same sources the day grain uses and under the
 * same class rules:
 *
 * | timezone class | week source                                    |
 * |----------------|------------------------------------------------|
 * | UTC            | `metrics_1d`, grouped by `toStartOfWeek(…, 1)` |
 * | local          | `metrics_15m`, grouped by the local Monday     |
 * | unservable     | not served — same reason day is not            |
 *
 * A UTC week always starts on a UTC midnight, so the day rollup's buckets nest
 * inside it exactly; a non-UTC week starts on a local midnight, which only the
 * atom rollup can honour, and only when the zone's offset is a whole number of
 * fifteen-minute atoms. Grouping (rather than summing seven day-buckets client-side) is also
 * what keeps weekly unique visitors correct: the read merges the stored
 * `uniq` states across the whole week instead of adding seven overlapping
 * counts.

 * The comparison range for a `[from, to)` request (docs snapshot 02 §18:
 * "comparison interval"; plan Milestone 7 item 9).
 *
 * The previous period is the equal-length half-open range that ends exactly where
 * the current one begins: `[from - span, from)`. It is derived here, in domain
 * code, so the API and any future caller compute the same comparison from the
 * same inputs rather than each doing date maths at the edge.
 *
 * The definition is span-based, not calendar-based, and that is deliberate: an
 * equal-UTC-span preceding window is exact and reversible, and it lines up bucket
 * for bucket with the current range at whatever grain answered it. A
 * calendar-based "same days last month" comparison changes length across DST and
 * month boundaries and is a Milestone 8 refinement once session facts land; the
 * metadata already carries the comparison range explicitly so a client is never
 * left guessing which window a comparison number came from.
 *
 * Returns `null` for a malformed or non-positive range, mirroring
 * `chooseResolution`'s total, throw-free contract.
