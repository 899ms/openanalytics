/**
 * The session read model: how a `[from, to)` range is split into a finalized and
 * a provisional layer, and how the additive session totals become bounce rate
 * and average durations (docs snapshot 02 §10, §15; 04 Milestone 8 items 6-7;
 * docs snapshot 05, D-211).
 *
 * This module is pure and deterministic, the same discipline `session.ts` and
 * `analytics-query.ts` keep, so the API read service and its tests reach the same
 * split from the same inputs. It contains no SQL and no clock.
 *
 * ## The two-layer read (§15)
 *
 * §15 is explicit: a long range reads the finalized `session_rollups_*`, and the
 * recent window past the site's `finalized_through` reads the provisional layer
 * straight from `session_facts_versions`. The danger is double-counting a session
 * that both sits in a finalized rollup bucket and is re-read from the provisional
 * facts. {@link splitSessionRange} makes the split **provably non-overlapping** by
 * cutting at a UTC bucket boundary derived from `finalized_through`:
 *
 *   - Let `B = floor(finalized_through)` to the source rollup's UTC bucket unit
 *     (a quarter-hour for the 15m-sourced reads, a day for the 1d-sourced read).
 *     `B` is bucket-aligned and `B <= finalized_through`.
 *   - **Finalized layer** reads rollup buckets with `bucket_start < B`. Every
 *     session in such a bucket has `session_start < B <= finalized_through`, so it
 *     is finalized and its rollup row will never change again (acceptance
 *     criterion 2). These buckets are read from `session_rollups_*`.
 *   - **Provisional layer** reads facts with `session_start >= B` — current truth
 *     via argMax-over-version-then-`retracted = 0` (migration 0013).
 *
 * A session with `session_start < B` lands only in the finalized read (its bucket
 * is `< B`); a session with `session_start >= B` lands only in the provisional
 * read (its bucket is `>= B`, excluded from the finalized read). The two layers
 * partition the sessions by `session_start` at the same aligned instant `B`, so no
 * session is counted twice and none is dropped. Checkpoint B's finalizer keeps
 * `finalized_through` pulled back so that no recomputed session's span straddles
 * it, which is what lets `session_start` alone decide the layer.
 *
 * When `finalized_through` is null (a site the finalizer has never run) `B`
 * collapses to `effectiveFrom`, so the whole range is provisional — the honest
 * answer for a site with no finalized rollups yet.
