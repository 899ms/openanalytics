/**
 * The server's resolution of the dashboard's nine interval keys, and the widget
 * read's typed config (ADR-0045, D5, D10 and D12).
 *
 * Until this module existed the nine keys were a **frontend** vocabulary:
 * `apps/web/components/dashboard/interval-context.tsx` turned each one into a
 * `from`/`to` pair before it called, and the server had never seen the word
 * `7d`. A widget stores the key instead, because an embed is a living thing on
 * somebody's page and a frozen window that ages silently is worse than a report
 * that says its date — so something on this side has to resolve it.
 *
 * **The obligation this module carries is agreement.** "Last 7 days" on an embed
 * must be the same window as "Last 7 days" in the owner's dashboard, or one site
 * publishes two different numbers under one label. `resolveWidgetRange` is
 * therefore `rangeForInterval`'s arithmetic, key by key, and not a
 * reinterpretation of it.
 *
 * Two things it does **not** inherit from the frontend, both by ADR-0045 D10:
 *
 * - The zone is the **site's** (`sites.reporting_timezone`, which every site has
 *   since migration 0046 — ADR-0079 D5) rather than the viewer's. A widget has
 *   no viewer to ask, and rendering "today" in a stranger's laptop clock would
 *   make one embed show two readers of the same page different numbers.
 * - `all` anchors at `first_event_at` alone, never at
 *   `min(created_at, first_event_at)`: ADR-0044 D7 keeps `created_at` off the
 *   public surface, and `meta.effective_range` would publish it.

 * over-counted `visitors` by 59 %. An embed has no interval picker and no

 * It also removes an error mode that would only ever be visible on somebody

 * embed goes blank. Every value is on the public timeseries allowlist ADR-0039

 * testable without a database.
 *
 * The shape of each answer, mirroring `rangeForInterval` exactly:
 *
 * - every key except `yesterday` and `24h` ends at **tomorrow's** local start,
 *   so the current day is included whole and the range never has to be re-cut as
 *   the day advances;
 * - the `Nd` keys count back `N - 1` whole days from today's start, so `7d` is
 *   seven calendar days *including today* rather than eight;
 * - `24h` is the one rolling window — measured from the request instant, not
 *   from a calendar boundary — so the zone cannot move it;
 * - `6mo`/`12mo` shift the calendar and add a day, which is what makes them
 *   "the last six months" rather than "the last 183 days".
