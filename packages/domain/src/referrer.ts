/**
 * What a client-sent referrer becomes on the way into the pipeline (ADR-0028).
 *
 * Two rules, and one definition of each, because `referrer_domain` is a
 * *grouping key*: it is the ORDER BY prefix of `sources_15m`/`sources_1d`, the
 * first-touch dimension of a session fact, a column of the visitor trail and a
 * field on the realtime feed. Anything that writes it differently from anything
 * else silently splits one acquisition source into several rows that no reader
 * can merge back — the rollups are additive and never rewritten.
 *
 * - **Self-referral is not a source.** A browser sends `document.referrer` on
 *   every navigation, including one from the site's own previous page, and the
 *   tracker forwards the previous URL on SPA route changes too
 *   (`apps/tracker/src/core.ts`). Stored as-is, the customer's own domain
 *   appears in their Sources report as an external referrer — which is what
 *   the 2026-07-28 bug report showed on a live site. An internal navigation has
 *   no acquisition source, so the referrer is NULL: the same value the report
 *   already renders as Direct.
 * - **The key is a domain, not a URL.** `www.google.com`, `google.com` and
 *   `google.com/search?q=…` are one source. The stored key is the lowercase,
 *   `www.`-less, port-less hostname.
 *
 * Why the collector and not the tracker: this must fix sites that are already
 * serving a cached `oa.js`, and the browser is the one participant whose code
 * we cannot re-deploy. Why not the read path: a rollup key that has to be
 * repaired at query time is a key that also has to be repaired in every future
 * reader, and `sources_15m` groups *before* any reader sees a row.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does **not** do: move referrer attribution to
 * the session grain. It makes the per-EVENT value correct and nothing more.
 *
 * **That end state has shipped (M12 CP4, ADR-0033 D6 — the deferral ADR-0028 §8
 * recorded is closed).** "A referrer is attributed once, at session entry" lives
 * in `packages/domain/src/revenue-attribution.ts`, which reads a visitor's
 * session entries out of `session_facts_versions` as the touchpoints of a
 * purchase and writes the first and last of them into `revenue_attributions`'
 * `ft_`/`lt_` blocks. The session fact gained `utm_content` and `utm_term` in
 * ClickHouse migration 0017 so a touchpoint carries the full 02 §13 source
 * vocabulary. The sources **report** stays event-grain on purpose: it answers
 * "where did this pageview come from", which is a different question from "which
 * journey earned this revenue", and this module is the one definition both of
 * them build on.
