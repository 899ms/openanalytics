/**
 * Typed environment validation with a per-service secret boundary.
 *
 * Docs snapshot 02 §5 and 04 Milestone 0 item 5: each service validates its own
 * environment at startup and is *not* given secrets it has no business holding.
 *
 * Two directions are enforced, and the second one is the point:
 *
 * 1. Required variables must be present and well-formed, or the process exits.
 *    Legacy relied on scattered non-null assertions and fallbacks (docs snapshot
 *    01 §15), which turns a misconfiguration into a runtime 500 much later.
 * 2. A variable a service must never hold is a hard startup failure, not a
 *    silently ignored value. If the collector is handed a ClickHouse credential,
 *    that is a deployment mistake worth failing on — the whole network design
 *    depends on the collector not being able to reach ClickHouse.

     * is a deliberate narrowing rather than an abandonment — the same shape
     * `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` took in M10, and worth stating precisely.
     *
     * **What the rule protects.** The key can re-derive an anonymous id from a
     * raw IP, so it belongs only where raw IPs are, and the collector is the one
     * service that ever sees one (D-102). That property is untouched: the worker
     * has never seen an IP, has no column that holds one, and `events_raw` has
     * no IP column for it to join against — `tests/migration/clickhouse-analytics`
     * asserts the schema has none. Holding the key here buys nobody the ability
     * to re-derive anything, because the other half of the derivation does not
     * exist on this side of the network.
     *
     * **Why it is needed.** D5's fact carries `external_user_hash`, which must be
     * the `identify()` derivation *byte for byte* or it joins against
     * `events_raw.user_id` and matches nothing. That derivation has to run over
     * provider-side identifiers (a Checkout `client_reference_id`), which only
     * the worker ever holds — the api receives them on the webhook and stores
     * them raw precisely because it must not gain this key, and the collector
     * never sees a provider payload at all.
     *
     * **What stays true.** The collector remains the only *writer* of event
     * identity. The worker uses the key read-only, to hash values that arrived
     * from a payment provider, and writes the result into revenue facts. Nothing
     * here can mint or alter an `events_raw` row.
     *
     * Optional like every other credential in this schema: the projection loop
     * does not start without it and logs one warning, rather than the worker

 * lives — `loadServiceEnv` validates them at boot but does not return them, so
 * the surface reads `process.env` a second time later. That second read has to
 * resolve paths too. Without it a deployment supplying one of a surface's
 * variables as a path would pass boot validation and then find nothing there
 * when the surface parsed for itself: green at startup, broken at the first
 * request that needed the value. Found by testing the extension branch rather
 * than assuming it behaved like the product's own.
 *
 * Throws rather than collecting, because by the time a surface parses, boot has
 * already reported every readable problem; anything failing here is a file that
 * changed underneath a running process.
