 * window Plausible, Fathom and Umami use (Matomo and GA4 use 30). It was 60 s,
 * which was twice the tracker's default heartbeat interval plus slack: enough to
 * survive one dropped heartbeat and nothing more. The accepted price is stated
 * rather than engineered away: a visitor who closed the tab lingers for up to
 * five minutes, because no browser signal reliably says "gone".
 *
 * Not the session boundary — `SESSION_INACTIVITY_MINUTES` is a different
 * question about a different store (02 §10).
 *
 * **A module constant rather than a policy value, deliberately** (ADR-0035, D4).
 * The distinction is not importance, it is how many processes must agree: the
 * gateway alone reads `REALTIME_SNAPSHOT_CACHE_SECONDS`, but this is a *store
 * format* — the collector writes it as a `PEXPIRE` and a trim bound, the gateway
 * reads it as a `ZCOUNT` min bound, and two services disagreeing would trim the
 * ZSET at one boundary while filtering it at another. As an environment variable
 * in two compose services that disagreement is one forgotten line away, and it
 * is invisible, because both halves keep working. Same class as
 * `PRESENCE_FEED_MAX`: a shape both sides of a key encode identically.
 *
 * Every TTL the touch sets is this value, so the resident key count is
 * `arrival rate x window` — five times what it was, bounded by score and not by
 * count. The snapshot's *metadata sample* is what
 * `REALTIME_SNAPSHOT_MAX_VISITORS` bounds; the ZSET behind it is not bounded at
 * all, and reports `truncated` instead.
