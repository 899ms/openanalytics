 * The identifier shape an IANA zone name has: a leading letter, then dot,
 * underscore, plus, minus and digits, in slash-separated segments. It is a
 * literal copy of the CHECK constraint on `users.timezone` (migration 0023), and
 * it is here for two reasons.
 *
 * The first is that wire and column constraints must agree. `Intl` is more
 * permissive than that CHECK, so a value it accepted but the constraint refused
 * would pass validation and then fail as an unhandled database error — a 500 for
 * what is a caller mistake. Keeping the same pattern on both sides makes the wire
 * validator a strict subset of the column's, and the CHECK a genuine floor under
 * it rather than a second, disagreeing opinion.
 *
 * The second is offsets. `Intl` accepts `+05:00`, `-08:00` and `+0500` as time
 * zones; this product does not (ADR-0026 alternatives). An offset is a timezone
 * evaluated at one instant, it goes wrong at every DST transition, and on the
 * analytics surface it reached ClickHouse and errored there anyway. A leading
 * letter is what separates a zone name from an offset, so requiring it turns all
 * three into a clean `400` before anything downstream sees them.
 *
 * The shape alone is not enough — `Not/AZone` matches it and is not a zone — so
 * this is an addition to the runtime check below, never a replacement for it.
