/**
 * Collector metric names.
 *
 * G-005 requires every limit trigger to emit a metric, and G-006 will bind them
 * to an alert pipeline. Names live in one table so an alert rule and the code
 * that fires it cannot drift, and so the set of things this service reports is
 * readable in one place rather than scattered across throw sites.
 *
 * Every name is a legal Prometheus metric name — `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`, so
 * `collector_x` and never `collector.x`. This table used dots until the M18
 * audit, and not one of these series had ever reached Grafana: the remote-write
 * exporter dropped the invalid name and the unit tests asserted against an
 * in-memory sink that accepts any string. The exporter now repairs a bad name
 * loudly instead of dropping it, but a repaired name publishes as something no
 * alert rule mentions — so the name written here is the name PromQL must use.
 *
 * Labels are low-cardinality by contract (`@openanalytics/observability`): a
 * site id is one series per customer, an IP or a user agent is unbounded and
 * would put visitor data in a store with no redaction. Nothing here is labelled
 * with either.
 *
 * Everything the ingest gate emits also carries `endpoint`, with exactly two
 * values — `events` and `heartbeat` (ADR-0035, D9). The gate refuses silently on
 * both paths by design (a bot gets the same answer as an accepted request; a
 * disallowed origin gets a 403 the tracker treats as final), and the shared
 * request metric's `route` label is the collector middleware's own mount `/*`
 * rather than the matched path. So a dropped heartbeat and a dropped batch used
 * to be one series, and "presence stopped updating" had no series that could say
 * why. Two series per site per counter instead of one, and no new cardinality
 * class.
