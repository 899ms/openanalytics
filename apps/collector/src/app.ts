/**
 * Public event intake.

 * The boundaries are fixed (docs snapshot 02 §7.1): the collector never inserts
 * into ClickHouse, never updates the Postgres usage hot row, never sends email
 * and never calls a provider API. It validates, resolves versioned site ingest
 * config, and hands the event to the durable queue — and only answers 202 once
 * that queue write is durable.
 *
 * The ingest routes are mounted only when their dependencies exist. A collector
 * with no queue is not a collector that accepts events optimistically; it is one
 * whose ingest endpoints are absent, which is a 404 an operator will notice
 * rather than a 202 for events nobody stored.

   * already registered `/health` by the time `createApp` gets the app back — a
   * middleware added afterwards never runs for a route registered before it.
   * The collector wants the opposite: `/health` is an operator endpoint that no
   * browser calls, so leaving it outside this middleware keeps its behaviour
   * byte-for-byte what it was. Same mechanism, opposite requirement, simpler
