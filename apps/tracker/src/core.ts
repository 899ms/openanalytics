 *
 * - the `event_id` is minted here, before the event reaches the transport, so a

 * - every signal passes the privacy gate before it becomes an event, and a
 *   linking hint additionally passes the site's own switch (ADR-0064);
 * - an SPA route change ends the previous route's engagement, resets the
 *   interaction ceiling and starts a new pageview — but not a new session
 *   (§10);
 * - the way out (`pagehide`, first `hidden`) reports vitals, collects final
