/**
 * Open Analytics browser tracker (v2).
 *
 * Dependency-free by construction: nothing under `apps/tracker/src` imports a
 * workspace package or a bare specifier, and `pnpm run boundaries` fails the
 * build if that changes. The legacy `public/v1.js` is not a starting point — it
 * is audited as a source of defects to avoid (docs snapshot 01 §5), and
 * backwards compatibility is explicitly not required (docs snapshot 05, D-004).
 *
 * The invariants the implementation keeps:
 *
 * - Every historical event carries a client-generated UUIDv7 `event_id`, minted
 *   *before* the first send attempt. A server-generated id cannot deduplicate a
 *   retry whose response was lost (docs snapshot 02 §7.1).
 * - `window.oa` is never overwritten when it belongs to someone else.
 * - The raw URL is never sent: fragments and sensitive query keys are stripped
 *   in the browser, and again on the server.
 * - The retry queue is bounded and expires at 24h; the server's time boundary is
 *   always the final authority.
 * - Heartbeats go to the realtime endpoint only, never into the historical batch.
 * - An input's value is never read, at any layer.
 *
 * This module is the typed entry point for tests and for an embedder that wants
 * the runtime without the auto-boot; `browser.ts` is the bundle entry that boots
 * itself from a script tag.
