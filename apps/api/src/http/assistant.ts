/**
 * The AI analytics assistant (ADR-0046).
 *
 * **It is a client of our own read surface that happens to live in the process
 * that serves it** — which is what MCP turned out to be, and the reason neither
 * is a second deployable (D2). Everything below is arranged around one sentence
 * from docs snapshot 02 §21: the assistant is a consumer of the existing
 * analytics service layer, not a second SQL generator and not an authorization
 * bypass.
 *
 * Three properties carry that, and none of them is asserted anywhere — each is
 * structural:
 *
 * - **The tools are `MCP_TOOLS`, imported** (D3), and a call is a real `Request`
 *   built by the shared builder and dispatched through the assembled app. So the
 *   live-membership check, the scope ceiling, the billing gate, the declared
 *   range ceiling and the `elapsed_ms` cost ledger all run, because it *is* the
 *   route. One question that reads one site writes one row in
 *   `read_cost_ledger`.
 * - **The credential is the caller's own session cookie** (D4), copied onto the
 *   dispatched request. There is no internal marker: the moment a read path
 *   trusts something other than a real credential, the loop stops being the
 *   route.
 * - **Nothing is stored** but ledger counts (D12). The transcript is the
 *   client's; the server holds no conversation, no message and no answer.
 *
 * What this file does own is the boundary with the model: the bounds (D7), the
 * role rule (D7), the scrubbing (D8), the freshness instruction (D9) and the
 * stream's four named events (D10).
