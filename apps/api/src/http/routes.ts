   * Delete a site (ADR-0030, decision 4).
   *
   * The most destructive endpoint in the product, and every guard in front of it

   *
   * - `siteMembership` — is the caller party to this site at all;
   * - `requireCapability('site:delete')` — the capability has existed since M2,
   *     is owner-only and has never had a caller until now;
   * - `isRecentReauth` — was the *session* recently proven, not merely valid.
   *     Deletion sits beside the billing cutover in that respect: a stolen laptop
   *     with a live cookie must not be able to erase a customer's history;
   * - the name confirmation — the human typed the site's own name. It is checked
   *     against the site's *current* name read in this request, never against a
   *     value the client sent alongside it, which would make the confirmation
   *     self-referential;
   * - `idempotent` — a retried request replays instead of starting a second
   *     deletion. The repository is idempotent as well (it returns the live
   *     request for a site already `deleting`), so the two agree rather than one
   *     covering for the other.
   *
   * The answer is `202`, not `200`: deletion is a state machine that runs for as
   * long as ClickHouse takes to rewrite its parts. The client polls
   * `GET /v1/sites/{id}` and reads `status`, which stays `deleting` until the
   * tombstone lands and the site disappears from the list entirely.

   * `config_version` in the same transaction so the tracker-config ETag and the
   * collector's ingest-config cache both invalidate.
   *
   * An empty object is refused rather than accepted as a no-op: a settings save
   * that changed nothing is far more likely a client bug than an intention.
   *
   * **`reporting_currency` is the odd field here** (ADR-0033, D2c; CP5 is its
   * first writer). It is validated against a closed list rather than only
   * against the column's `^[A-Z]{3}$` CHECK, because `ZZZ` passes the regexp and
   * a site set to it gets `conversion_source = 'unavailable'` on every single
   * transaction — an entirely empty revenue dashboard produced by a typo, with
   * no error anywhere to explain it. And it is not merely a setting: changing it
   * re-materializes every stored fact and re-rolls every bucket, which the
   * repository performs in the same transaction as the write so the two halves
   * cannot commit apart. It deliberately does NOT bump `config_version` — the
   * collector has never heard of a reporting currency.
   *
   * The capability is `site:settings` rather than the owner-only `revenue:read`,
   * matching this route's existing model: an admin who may already replace the
   * origin allowlist is trusted with the label the numbers are denominated in.
   * Reading the numbers stays owner-only.
   *
   * **`reporting_timezone` is the site's own clock** (ADR-0044 D4, ADR-0079 D5),
   * and it is this route's second non-bumping field for the same reason as the
   * first. Every window this product cuts — the dashboard's, the share board's,
   * every widget's — starts and ends on it, so two viewers in two countries stop
   * cutting different buckets behind one link, and ADR-0026's user preference is
   * the fallback for a reader with no site to ask rather than the default.
   *
   * **`null` is refused.** It cleared the setting while the column was nullable;
   * since migration 0046 there is no such state to return to, and a site with no
   * clock is a site whose readers disagree about what a week is. A reader who
   * wants their own zone switches to it from the dashboard's header pill, which
   * is a view and writes nothing.

   * `team:manage`, plus one rule this route enforces itself: **only a caller
   * whose own role is `owner` may grant or revoke the `owner` role.** Without it
   * an `admin` — who holds `team:manage` — could promote themselves to owner,
   * which is a privilege escalation, or demote the owners above them.
   *
   * The target's current role is read *before* any write, because half of that
   * rule is about the target ("an admin may not demote an owner") and
   * `updateMemberRole` only reports `previousRole` once it has already written.
   * The window between this read and that write is not fully closed: the
   * repository's `SELECT ... FROM sites FOR UPDATE` serializes the *writes*
   * against each other — concurrent role changes, removals and the D-010 cutover
   * cannot interleave — but it is taken after this read, so it does not make the
   * read part of the same critical section. What bounds the residual risk is that
   * the invariants that actually matter are database-enforced and re-checked at
   * commit: a site keeps at least one owner (`OA001`) and the billing owner stays
   * an owner (`OA002`), whatever this route believed a moment earlier. Closing
   * the window entirely would mean moving the caller/target role comparison
   * inside the repository transaction.
   *
   * The two invariants are left to those deferred triggers rather than
   * pre-checked here, so they hold under concurrency instead of only in the
   * happy path.
