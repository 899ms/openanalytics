/**
 * The anonymous widget read: `GET /v1/widget/{widget_id}` (ADR-0045, CP2).
 *
 * A sibling of the public share reads, not a parameter on them — a share slug
 * addresses a *board* with per-surface flags, a widget id addresses *one
 * answer* — and underneath it is **the same read pipeline**: the same `public*`
 * service methods, the same gateway operations, the same `PublicAnalyticsMeta`,
 * the same rollups (ADR-0043 D10's rule that a second surface must be the
 * routes themselves rather than something that resembles them). No new query
 * path, no second copy of the range logic, no new response *rows*.
 *
 * What is genuinely new here is four things, and each one has its own comment
 * below:
 *
 * 1. **The request carries nothing.** Surface, range, row cap and timezone are
 *    all stored configuration, so there is nothing to validate and no `400` on
 *    this route. That is §20's "read widgets can see only an explicit public
 *    metric and date range" in its strongest available form — not an
 *    allowlist checked per request, but a request with no room to carry
 *    anything.
 * 2. **The range is resolved server-side**, in the site's own reporting zone,
 *    by `resolveWidgetRange` (ADR-0045 D10).
 * 3. **`realtime` does not go through the query gateway.** It is the one widget
 *    read served from the presence cache, as a cacheable snapshot poll rather
 *    than an SSE connection held open from a stranger's page.
 * 4. **A second, per-object CORS allowlist** beside `credentialedCors`'s
 *    app-origin one. They are kept apart deliberately: one exists to let our own
 *    dashboard carry a session cookie, the other to let a stranger's page render
 *    a public number without one — so this middleware never learns about
 *    `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and never sets `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`.
 *
 * No session, no membership, no capability, and no per-surface board flag: a
 * widget is its own opt-in surface (ADR-0045 D11), gated on its own row plus
 * `sites.status === 'active'` and nothing else. It deliberately does **not**
 * read `site_public_dashboard_settings` — requiring an owner to publish a whole
 * board before they may embed one number would be more disclosure to get less.
