/**
 * Resolves a *revenue* request to its rollup pair and effective range
 * (ADR-0033, D7; ClickHouse migration 0018). Milestone 12 Checkpoint 5.
 *
 * `resolveSession` again, and deliberately so: the revenue rollups have exactly
 * the session rollups' shape — 15m and 1d only, no minute grain, versioned
 * generation swaps rather than an incremental view — so the grain decision is
 * the same decision. Two consequences follow, and each is the session rule
 * with money in it:
 *
 * - **A minute-tier range is served at hour grain.** "Today" on a revenue chart
 *   is hourly, which is also the finest grain the money is meaningful at — a
 *   per-minute revenue series is noise around individual transactions, and the
 *   transactions list is the surface for those.
 * - **A non-UTC day is composed from the atom rollup**, so a DST 23/25-hour day
 *   sums the hours it actually had — in every zone, since ADR-0079 step 3 put
 *   `revenue_15m` under the composition.
 *
 * The summary shares this resolver rather than having one of its own: a range
 * total is the same buckets without the `GROUP BY`, so a range the chart refuses
 * is a range the total would have to guess at.
