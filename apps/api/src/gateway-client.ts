/**
 * Signed service client for the query gateway (docs snapshot 05, D-208; plan
 * Milestone 7 item 5).
 *
 * This is the *only* way the API reaches analytics data. It never opens a
 * ClickHouse connection — the API is forbidden a ClickHouse credential
 * (packages/domain/src/env.ts FORBIDDEN_KEYS) — and it never speaks SQL. It posts
 * an allowlisted operation ID with typed parameters to `POST /v1/query`, under a
 * short-lived Ed25519 signature bound to method, path, body hash, audience and a
 * single-use nonce (the signing half lives in `@openanalytics/auth`; the gateway
 * verifies with the public key only).
 *
 * Two invariants this client keeps, both from AGENTS.md:
 *
 * - **A provider failure is never an empty result.** A dead gateway, a timeout or
 *   a non-2xx answer becomes a typed `ApiError`, never `{ rows: [] }`. The caller
 *   turns that into degraded/unavailable response metadata; it must not be able
 *   to mistake "the gateway is down" for "this site has no data".
 * - **The response's emptiness must stay interpretable.** The gateway's own
 *   `meta` (row_count, truncated, elapsed_ms, cached) is passed straight through
 *   so the read route can surface truncation and cache state.

 * it into its cache key, so a block, a reactivation or a deletion start makes
 * every entry cached under the previous version unreachable. It is never bound

   * else to look at. `GET /v1/sites` is the opposite shape (ADR-0080 D6): it is
   * the dashboard shell's own load, its card figures are a decoration, and
   * twenty seconds of shell waiting on a decoration is a broken product. So that
   * caller passes a short one and renders `null` when it expires.
   *
   * It can only ever be shorter in practice — nothing in the product raises it —
   * but nothing structural enforces that, because the gateway and ClickHouse
   * have their own ceilings underneath and a longer value here would simply be
