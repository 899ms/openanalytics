          A read-only version of your site&apos;s numbers at a link anyone
          can open, no account needed: totals, the traffic chart,
          engagement, geography, pages, sources and devices, over any range
          the visitor picks. You turn it on under your site&apos;s Settings,
          in the Public dashboard panel, and the link is minted there.

          The page opens on your site&apos;s reporting timezone, the same
          clock your dashboard and widgets use. A visitor picks their own
          range and can switch the timezone (searchable by country or city),
          so a reader in another country can read your day on their own
          clock. Their choices touch nothing of yours.

      <DocSection title="Revoking a link">
        <DocNote>
          Rotate link mints a new address and the old one stops working
          immediately, including any open live streams. Turning the
          dashboard off keeps the address but answers nothing. Share pages
          are deliberately not indexed by search engines; public means
          whoever has the link, not findable in Google. For embedding a
          single number instead of a whole board, use{" "}
          <DocLink slug="widgets">widgets</DocLink>.
