              under Settings, Installation. It is public by design:

          <Code>npx getopen init</Code> does the paste for you: it detects
          the framework, asks for the tracking key, writes the snippet into
          the right file and tells you which file it changed. It is
          idempotent; a project that already carries the snippet is left
          alone. See <DocLink slug="cli">the CLI page</DocLink> for
          everything else it can do.

          The realtime view is the fastest signal: open your site once and
          the visit appears within seconds. Historical charts pass through
          the batch pipeline and typically land in about two seconds. The
          dashboard&apos;s install step also flips to done on its own the
          moment the first event arrives.

      <DocSection title="The origin allowlist">
        <DocNote>
          If your site has domains configured in Settings, events are
          accepted only from those hosts. An empty domain list means
          unconfigured, which accepts any origin; it never means deny all.
          Adding your first domain narrows what is accepted, so if you test
          from a staging host, add it too. A tag on a host the site does not
          count says so: the tracker writes one line in the browser console
          naming the host and the allowed domains, and the dashboard&apos;s
          waiting screen names the same host and offers{" "}
          <strong>Allow this domain</strong>. localhost can never be listed,
          so visits are counted from the site&apos;s own domain.
