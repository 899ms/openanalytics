              listed, since a single-label host is not a domain: test on the

      <DocSection title="An event is counted twice">
        <p>
          The one way to double-bill a click is describing it twice yourself
          under the same name with two mechanisms: a{" "}
          <Code>data-oa-event</Code> attribute plus an{" "}
          <Code>oa.track()</Code> call of the same name on the same element.
          Pick one. A dashboard rule with the same name is safe; the rule
          wins and exactly one event fires. Details on{" "}

      <DocSection title="Keeping your own visits out">
        <p>
          Create a separate site for staging and local environments and point
          those snippets at its own tracking key: their traffic then lands in
          its own dashboard instead of production&apos;s. There is no
          per-person exclusion cookie, because the product does not recognise
          people; separating environments is the honest version. (The old{" "}
          <Code>data-test-mode</Code> attribute is retired and ignored —
          traffic from snippets still carrying it is ordinary and visible.)
