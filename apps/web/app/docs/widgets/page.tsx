          document you can put in an iframe anywhere: a README rendered as
          HTML, a status page, your own marketing site. Viewers need no

          A widget&apos;s window (Today, Last 7 days) is cut server-side in
          the site&apos;s reporting timezone, set under Site Settings,
          General. Every site has one. This is deliberate: a public widget
          cannot ask each reader for a timezone, so it reads the site&apos;s.
          The whole clock story is on{" "}
