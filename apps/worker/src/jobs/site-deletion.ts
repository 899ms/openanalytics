/**
 * The fenced site-deletion executor (ADR-0030, decision 4).
 *
 * Seven phases, run in order, each of them idempotent and each of them resumable
 * from the durable state two tables hold: `jobs.phase` says which phase to enter
 * and `deletion_targets` says what is already done inside it. A worker that dies
 * mid-purge is recovered by another worker stealing the expired lease and
 * re-entering the same phase, which finds the completed targets and skips them.
 *
 * The phase order is the correctness argument, not a pipeline convenience:
 *
 * - `fence_drain` is first because nothing may be purged while a collector
 *   request can still admit an event for the site. Two things have to become
 *   true: the config cache TTL plus a margin must have elapsed since the start
 *   transaction (so no request can still be holding a snapshot that says
 *   "active"), and every `ingest_batch_sites` registration at a superseded
 *   generation must have settled (so no worker is mid-insert).
 * - `finalizer_fence` is second because the session finalizer is the one
 *   subsystem that writes ClickHouse *without* passing the ingest fence. A run
 *   that claimed the site before deletion started would happily insert fact and
 *   rollup rows after a verified purge. Taking and holding its lease is what
 *   closes that window; the driver-side status filter (decision 7) cannot,
 *   because a run already in flight outlives any filter.
 * - `redis_purge` precedes `postgres_purge` because the realtime epoch keys are
 *   enumerated from the `site_members` rows the Postgres purge deletes. Reversed,
 *   one epoch key per ex-member would be left behind with no way to find it
 *   short of a keyspace `SCAN`.
 * - `object_purge` works a key list the *start transaction* snapshotted, so it
 *   only has to precede `postgres_purge` — the rows those keys were read from
 *   are what that phase deletes. It sits early because it is quick and certain,
 *   and a deletion that stalls in the ClickHouse mutations should stall with the
 *   customer's uploaded archives already gone (ADR-0032, D9).
 * - `verify_finalize` is last and re-reads every target rather than trusting the
 *   phases that ran: the tombstone is a statement to the customer that their
 *   data is gone, and it is made only against observed verification.
 *
 * **Waiting is not failing.** Every "not yet" is a returned `retry`, which the
 * runner records without counting an attempt (`failJobRetryable(resetAttempts)`).
 * Only an unexpected error throws, and those attempts are what `JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
 * bounds. A deletion may therefore wait days on a drain and still have its full
 * retry budget for the ClickHouse mutation that follows.

 * phase's `count() = 0`: the delete call reporting success is progress, and an
 * observation of absence is truth. It matters more here than it looks, because
 * `delete` is idempotent by contract and therefore cannot itself distinguish
 * "removed it" from "storage never saw it".
 *
 * Two "not yet" cases, both returned retries rather than failures:
 *
 * - **no credential and keys to delete.** The phase waits for the restart that
 *   provides it. Skipping would be a deletion claiming to have erased bytes it
 *   never reached — the one thing this whole subsystem exists to prevent.
 * - **a key that still heads.** Rare (S3 delete is strongly consistent), but the
 *   Hetzner `NoSuchBucket` flap is exactly the condition under which a `head`
 *   could answer wrongly, which is why the adapter now classifies that as an
 *   outage instead of as absence.
 *
 * An empty key list completes immediately. Most sites have never imported
 * anything, and a target that cannot be worked would otherwise have to be either
 * skipped or waited on forever.

/**
 * Delete the site's rows from every analytics table and prove it
 * (ADR-0030, D4 `clickhouse_purge`).
 *
 * Three states per target, all durable, which is what makes the phase resumable
 * across a worker restart:
 *
 * - **no `mutation_id`** — nothing submitted. Submit and record the id.
 * - **`mutation_id`, not `verified`** — a mutation is in flight. Poll it; a
 *   `latest_fail_reason` records the error, meters the failure and retries,
 *   because a failed mutation in ClickHouse is almost always a resource
 *   condition rather than a bad statement.
 * - **`verified`** — a `SELECT count()` has observed zero rows. Skipped forever.
 *
 * The verification is the only statement that observes the end state rather than
 * progress, and it is why `is_done` alone is not accepted as completion. A
 * mutation reported done with rows still present is a real anomaly: the mutation
 * id is cleared so the next attempt re-submits, and the error is recorded on the
 * target rather than swallowed.
 *
 * One pass walks every ClickHouse target — submitting the ones with no mutation,
 * polling the ones that have one — and returns a retry if any is still
 * outstanding. That is bounded work by construction: one statement per target over
 * one site's part sets, each a `WHERE site_id = …` over tables partitioned
 * by month. The alternative, one table per job attempt, would multiply the
 * wall-clock time by the poll interval for no reduction in total server work,
 * since ClickHouse queues mutations per table regardless of when they arrive.
 * The job runner's own `limit: 1` is what keeps *deletions* from overlapping.
