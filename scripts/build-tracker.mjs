/**
 * Builds the browser tracker bundle and enforces its size budget.
 *
 * Docs snapshot 04, Milestone 4 item 10. The tracker executes on customers'
 * sites, so its size is not our cost — it is theirs, paid on every page load by
 * every visitor. A budget that is only measured in review is not a budget, so it
 * is measured here and enforced in CI.
 *
 * The number and its justification are in
 * `docs/adr/0008-milestone-4-tracker-and-event-contract.md`. It is an
 * engineering budget, not a `GATE` value: raising it is an ADR edit with a
 * measurement, not a product decision.
 *
 * esbuild is a dev dependency. The bundle itself stays dependency-free — that is
 * enforced separately by `pnpm run boundaries`.
