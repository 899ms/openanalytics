 * The "empty DB bootstrap test in the same PR" acceptance line.
 *
 * Runs the real PRODUCT stream (`packages/postgres/migrations`) against a
 * genuinely empty schema and proves four things:
 *   1. the product schema builds from empty ON ITS OWN, and its ledger records
 *      exactly the versions on disk (derived from the directory, so a new
 *      migration cannot be forgotten here);
 *   2. the cloud stream then applies cleanly on top (deploy order:
 *      product first, then cloud — its own asserts live in
 *      `cloud-schema.test.ts`);
 *   3. the Drizzle schema objects have not drifted from the SQL — every column
 *      each table declares actually exists in the migrated database (ADR-0006's
 *      mitigation for defining the schema in two places);
 *   4. re-running both streams applies nothing.
 *
 * Skipped without TEST_POSTGRES_URL so a contributor with no database can still
 * run the rest of the suite; CI always provides one.
