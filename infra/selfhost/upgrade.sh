#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Upgrade this deployment to the version of the tree you are standing in.
#
#   git fetch --tags && git checkout v0.2.0
#   cd infra/selfhost && ./upgrade.sh
#
# Run it from the NEW checkout: the script that performs the upgrade ships with
# the version being upgraded to, so it already knows what that version needs.
#
# ## What it does, in order
#
#   1. works out which images this checkout wants;
#   2. tells you the three costs below and waits for a yes;
#   3. takes a cold snapshot of both stores — `./snapshot.sh create` — which
#      stops the stack;
#   4. writes the new tag into `.env`;
#   5. pulls (or builds) and brings everything up. Migrations run first and the
#      services wait for them, so a failed migration stops the upgrade instead
#      of leaving a fleet of services against a half-built schema.
#
# ## THERE IS NO DOWN MIGRATION, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN
#
# Migrations here are forward-only. Going back a version is therefore not
# "migrate down" — it is a RESTORE of the snapshot step 3 took, which is what
# `./rollback.sh` does. The consequence is the second cost below, and it is
# stated before the upgrade starts rather than in the rollback instructions,
# because that is where somebody can still decide differently.

usage: ./upgrade.sh [--to <vX.Y.Z>] [--from-source] [--keep <n>] [--yes]

  --to           the release to run. Defaults to the tag this checkout is on,
                 which is what you want after `git checkout vX.Y.Z`.
  --from-source  build the images here instead of pulling them. What to use on
                 an architecture the release does not publish, or to run a
                 branch. Needs the build toolchain and about ten minutes.
  --keep         keep only the newest <n> snapshots afterwards. Default: keep
                 everything, and print how much room they are taking.
  --yes          do not ask. For a scripted upgrade whose costs you have
                 already accepted; the three of them are printed either way.
  --skip-backup  UPGRADE WITH NO WAY BACK. Only sensible when you have just
                 taken a snapshot by hand, or when this install holds nothing
                 you would miss.

Upgrading this deployment.

Three things this costs. None of them is recoverable after the fact, so they are
here rather than in the documentation:

  1. DOWNTIME, for as long as the snapshot and the restart take — minutes on a
     small install, longer with a large ClickHouse volume. Everything stops,
     including the collector, so events that visitors' browsers try to send
     during the window are REFUSED AND LOST. The tracker does not retry them.
     Pick a quiet hour.

  2. GOING BACK LOSES DATA. There are no down migrations, by decision, so
     ./rollback.sh restores the snapshot taken in a moment — and every event,
     account and setting recorded AFTER that snapshot is discarded with it. The
     further you get from this moment, the more expensive the decision to go
     back becomes. That is the trade this project made in exchange for never
     shipping a reverse migration that was written but never run.

  3. DISK. The snapshot is a compressed copy of both stores and nothing deletes
     it for you. ./snapshot.sh list shows what has accumulated; --keep prunes.

Check the services are answering, and that they are the version you think:

  docker compose ps
  docker compose exec api node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8082/health').then(r=>r.json()).then(o=>console.log(o.commit,o.status))"

and that no history fill failed (none of these lines is the good answer; a
failed fill does not stop the stack, and the next "docker compose up -d"
retries it):

  docker compose logs migrate | grep 'history fill'

DONE

if [ -n "$SNAPSHOT" ]; then
	cat <<DONE
If this went badly:

  ./rollback.sh --to ${SNAPSHOT}

which restores the stores to the moment before this upgrade and discards
everything recorded since. Read cost 2 above again before running it.
DONE
