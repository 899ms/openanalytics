# ## This is the only way back, and it is lossy
#
# Migrations here are forward-only — there are no down migrations, by decision.
# So "roll back" cannot mean "undo the schema change": it means put the data
# directories back the way they were and run the code that matches them.
#
# EVERYTHING RECORDED AFTER THE SNAPSHOT IS DISCARDED. Events, accounts, sites,
# tracking keys, event definitions, settings — all of it, because the stores are
# replaced wholesale rather than edited. There is no partial version of this
# operation and no merge.
#
# `./upgrade.sh` says so before it starts, which is the point where the choice is
# still cheap. If you are reading it here first: the number that matters is how
# long the deployment has been running the new version, because that is exactly
# what you are throwing away.
#
# ## What it puts back
#
#   * both data volumes, from the snapshot's archives;
#   * `env/*.env` and `docker-compose.override.yml` — the configuration that
#     matches those volumes. The current ones are moved aside first, never
#     deleted, so a rollback is itself reversible;
#   * `OA_IMAGE_REPO` / `OA_IMAGE_TAG` in `.env`, to the release the snapshot
#     was taken from, and then that release's images are pulled and started.
#
# It does NOT check the tree out for you. The compose file and the migrations
# belong to the version too, so a rollback across versions is:
#
#   git checkout v0.1.0 && cd infra/selfhost && ./rollback.sh --to <snapshot>

usage: ./rollback.sh --to <snapshot dir> [--keep-config] [--no-pre-backup] [--yes]

  --to              which snapshot. ./snapshot.sh list shows them.
  --keep-config     do not restore env/*.env or the key-pair override. Use this
                    when you changed configuration AFTER the snapshot and want
                    to keep that change — a new SMTP password, say. The store
                    passwords must still match, so only do it if you know the
                    ones in place are the snapshot's.
  --no-pre-backup   do not snapshot the CURRENT state first. Faster, needs no
                    disk, and makes this irreversible.
  --yes             skip the confirmation. The confirmation is a typed word, not
                    a keypress, because of what this does.

Rolling this deployment back.

  snapshot      ${FROM}
  taken         ${TAKEN_AT}
  its tree      ${SNAP_TREE}
  its images    ${SNAP_REPO}/*:${SNAP_TAG}

  running now   ${NOW_TAG}
  this checkout ${HERE}

EVERYTHING RECORDED SINCE ${TAKEN_AT} WILL BE DISCARDED.

Both data volumes are replaced by the snapshot's copies. Every event collected
since, every account created since, every setting changed since: gone, with no
partial or merged outcome available. There are no down migrations to run instead
— this is the whole of the way back, by design.

POSTGRES IS NOT IN THIS SNAPSHOT. It lives with your provider, and this script
cannot roll it back. It restores ClickHouse and the configuration, then STOPS
with the stack down. You then restore Postgres to ${SNAP_STOPPED_AT} (Neon: the
branch's point-in-time restore) and start the stack yourself.
