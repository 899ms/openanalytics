# Self-host package

The supported way to run OpenAnalytics on your own hardware.
**The instructions are in [`/SELF-HOSTING.md`](../../SELF-HOSTING.md)** at the
repository root — this file only says what is in this directory.

```sh
./generate-secrets.sh --domain analytics.example --email admin@analytics.example
docker compose pull      # a release's eight images; omit to build them here
docker compose up -d
```

| Path                      | What                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker-compose.yml`      | The whole stack. Its header explains the four load-bearing choices.       |
| `generate-secrets.sh`     | Writes `.env`, `env/*.env` and the key-pair override, in one pass         |
| `upgrade.sh`              | Snapshot, then move to the release this checkout is on                    |
| `rollback.sh`             | Restore a snapshot — the only way back, because migrations do not go down |
| `snapshot.sh`             | The cold backup and restore both of those are built on                    |
| `NEON.md`                 | Postgres on Neon instead of in this stack — step by step                  |
| `docker-compose.neon.yml` | The overlay that takes `postgres` out of the stack, for `NEON.md`         |
| `.env.example`            | The values compose interpolates — hostnames and the network. No secrets.  |
| `env/*.env.example`       | One template per service. There is no shared environment; see below.      |
| `Caddyfile`               | TLS front for the four public names. **Read its header before editing.**  |
| `nginx.conf.example`      | The same shape for nginx, if you already run one                          |
| `web.Dockerfile`          | The dashboard image (the backend uses `../docker/node-app.Dockerfile`)    |
| `clickhouse/`             | Entrypoint that provisions the four least-privilege users, and config     |
| `valkey/`                 | Entrypoint and the two policy files — durable queue, losable cache        |
| `geoip/`                  | Where you put a City-schema `.mmdb`. Empty: it may not be redistributed.  |

Two things that surprise people, both explained at length in the compose
header and in `/SELF-HOSTING.md`:

- **There is no shared `.env` for the services.** Each one validates its own
  environment and exits if handed a secret it must not hold. That boundary is
  what keeps the internet-facing collector away from ClickHouse and the query
  gateway away from the key it verifies with.
- **The Valkey URLs are IP addresses, not service names.** The queue client
  refuses a plaintext URL to a host it cannot prove is private, and a compose
  service name is not one.

This directory is generic on purpose: it describes a reference deployment. The
hosted service's own machine configuration is maintained outside this tree and
is not part of the self-hosting path.
