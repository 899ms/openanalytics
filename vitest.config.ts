/**
 * Test projects are separated by what they need to run, not by subject matter
 * (docs snapshot 04, Milestone 0 item 9):
 *
 * - `unit`      — pure logic. No network, no containers. Runs on every commit.
 * - `contract`  — OpenAPI/schema agreement and HTTP envelope shape. No infra.
 * - `tracker`   — the browser tracker, in a DOM environment. Separate from
 *                 `unit` only because it needs `happy-dom`; it needs no network
 *                 and runs on every commit too.
 * - `integration` — needs real dependencies (Redis, ClickHouse, Postgres).
 * - `migration` — needs empty Postgres/ClickHouse instances to prove a database
 *                 can be built from the repository and that drift is detected.
 *
 * Keeping them apart means a contributor without Docker can still run the checks
 * that gate most changes, while CI runs all four.
